                <p class="challenge-text">
                    Github is a website and platform where software developers (you) can store, share and colloborate on
                    code.
                    Its pretty much like google drive but for code. So you might ask WHY do we need VS code? Well its
                    helpful in many ways like
                    storing your code, backing up code, working with others on the same project, tracks bugs and changes
                    and it allows us to show
                    our work for future employers. HEHEHEHEHEHE.
                </p>

                <p class="challenge-text">
                    Now in Github there is a tool called "Git". This tool allows us to track changes in our code like
                    when you save your video game after you left off
                    or when you hit the flag when playing mario bros(I love Mario bros). So yeah its just a checkpoint
                    for us when we save/commit our code.
                    Here are some useful commands that we should know when using Git:
                </p>
                <ul class="challenge-text">
                    <li>\git init: Starts a new Git project.</li>
                    <li>\git add: Adds files.</li>
                    <li>\git commit: Commits the staged changes to the repository.</li>
                    <li>\git status: Shows what's changed.</li>
                    <li>\git push: Pushes the local changes to the remote repository.</li>
                    <li>\git pull: Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="challenge-text">
                    Now theres are all commands that can be used in your terminal. The temrminal is a command line
                    interface that allows you to interact with your computer using text commands.
                    You can open the terminal in VS Code by going to the top menu and clicking on "Terminal" then "New
                    Terminal" or by clicking ctrl + ` (the backtick key).
                    Now with this knowledge lets go ahead and create a new repository on Github and clone it to your
                    local machine(VS Code) to get the crown!
                </p>
                <!-- when the start button is clicked the crown and submit placeholders should show otherwise they are hidden-->
                <button type="button" class="start-button" id="start-button">Start</button>
                <input type="text" class="crown-input" placeholder="Crown" id="crown-input"></input>
                <button type="button" class="submit-button" id="submit-button">Submit</button>
            </div>

            <!-- Challenge 2-->
            <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="collapsible">Hello World!<img src="crown.png" class="crownImg"
                    style="display:none;"></button>
            <div class="bar-content">
                <p class="challenge-text"> Okay now that we know what Github is and how to use it lets go ahead and
                    create a new
                    repository and clone it to our local machine.
                    You can always follow my video tutorial for a step-by-step guide!

                <p class="challenge-text">
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: Got to github and click "new repository"</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Name your repository "hello-world". You can choose to create a desrcription/public or
                        private/ and a README file. Then click create repository.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Create a branch. A branch in github is pretty much like a seperate version of your code
                        where you can make changes without messing up the main code so for now we are going to click
                        main.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking the "Code"
                        button and copying the URL. Then, in your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to
                        clone the repository and run the command "git clone [URL]".</li>
                    <li>Step 5: Open the cloned repository in VS Code. You can do this by going to the File menu and
                        selecting "Open Folder..." and then selecting the folder where you cloned the repository.</li>

                </ul>

            <!-- Challenge 3-->
            <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="collapsible">Uploading to Github<img src="crown.png"
                    class="crownImg" style="display:none;" id="challenge3"></button>
            <div class="bar-content">
                <p class="challenge-text"> The reason why I am adding in a DIV & Flexbox section is becuase I feel
                    this
                    is very missed
                    when taking a lot of 'learn to code' courses. This is a very important part of HTML and CSS
                    becuase
                    untimately
                    this is how we are going to structure our webpages and we need to understand how they work.
                    <img src="keepGoing.jpg" alt="keep going meme" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
                    Okay we are going to think of Div as a box. So I created multiple boxes for this webpage. I can
                    put
                    anything
                    inside my box. I can put text, images, videos, etc. I can also put other boxes inside my box.
                    This
                    is called nesting.
                    Now a flexbox is a magic box. If I put a flexbox inside a div it can arrage the toys inside the
                    box
                    in a way that I want.
                    I can make the toys inside the box go in a row or a column. I can also make the toys inside the
                    box
                    grow or shrink.
                    So in the end a div is a plain empty box and a flexbox controls hows the stuff inside is
                    arranged
                    using our IMAGINATION (IF YOU KNOW THIS EXACT REFERENCE AND WHY
                    I USED IT YOUR A REAL ONE).
                    <img src="imagination.gif" alt="imagination meme" style="width:100px;height:100px;">

                </p>
                <p>
                    here is an example and output of what we should expect for our divs and spans
                </p>
                <p>
                    now that you know a little bit about divs and spans lets try to make some divs and spans to get
                    the
                    crown!
                </p>
                <button type="button" class="start-button" onclick="startFunction()">Start</button>

                    class="crownImg" style="display:none;"></button>
            <div class="bar-content">
                <p class="challenge-text"> Now I know ... the coding process takes FOREVER! but we are almost done
                    with
                    the basics!
                    lets go ahead and go over the HTML layout. The layout of a webpage is how the elements are
                    arranged
                    on the page. Think of it like the box(I know so many boxes) but this is the master of all master
                    boxes that is the &lt;html&gt; tags.
                    Inside out html tags which is our master box we can place our divs, paragraphs, headers, images,
                    and
                    everything you can think of to make out webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The header is the top used for the website logo like code.college! the navigation bar is the
                    menu
                    above that lists the home, forts, chat, help and login button. Next we have the side bar that
                    could
                    be used for
                    ads, links or other information. Content is the main part of the webpage where the main
                    information
                    is displayed. The footer is the bottom of the webpage where you can put the copyright
                    information.
                    One other thing
                    we should note are comments when you want to add a comment to your code you can use the
                    <!-- comment here --> tag
                    Behind the scenes of this webpage are many MANY comments that help the developers understand the
                    code and what it does.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this knowledge lets try to make a webpage layout to get the crown!
                </p>
