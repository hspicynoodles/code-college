    <h1>Learn to Code!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to code.college! My name is Heather and I am currently a CS student at Arizona State University.
      This webstie was insired by my challening(although fun....sometimes) journey through my CSE 365 class.
      I wanted to create a website that would actually help students learn the material and apply it to real-world
      projects.
      I have always stuggles with learning how to code more on the outside of classes then in them.
      I hope this website helps you learn the material and apply it to real-world projects and how to go from
      start to finish!
    </p>

    <h2>Coding Applications</h2>
    <p>code.college teaches and applies our skills on small projects, allowing you to dive deeper into your
      understanding of the material. We have a variety of projects that you can work on and learn from. With these
      projects, you can learn how to apply your skills in a real-world setting while learning the basics.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy your journey! If you have comments, suggestions, or feedback, please email me at hrmacias@asu.edu</p>

    <h3>Getting Started - Learn the Basics</h3>
    <p>The material on code.college is split into different "forts." Each fort will cover a topic, and with that
      information, you will need to hard-code your way to get the crown.
    </p>
    <p>Each fort will have a different topic and a set of challenges. The challenges will be based on the topic of
      the fort and will require you to use the information you've learned to solve them.
    </p>
    <p>Note: If you run into problems with concepts and challenges, you can get help on our Discord server!</p>
