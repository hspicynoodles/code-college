        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>Now what is Javascript? Whenever we code our own websites we pretty much have just pages with a bunch of
            divs,
            icons and body elements. Javascript allows us to add functionality and interactive. </p>

            <div class="bar-content">
                <p class="challenge-text">Okay so the first thing wer are going to learn are varibles. Variables in
                    Javascript is like a labeled
                    box where we can label them and store something inside. There are different types of variables in
                    Javascript such as
                    let, const and var. The most common one is let. These are all different scoping variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scoping: to keep varibles in differnt areas of the program. Refer to resources for more information!
                </p>
                <div class="coding-example">
                    <p class="code-text">

                        <!-- // &lt; is a '<' and &gt; is a '>' -->
                        let myVariable = "Hello World"; <br>
                        const s = "Hello";<br>
                        var x = 5; <br>
                        console.log(myVariable); <br>
                        console.log(s); <br>
                        console.log(x); <br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="challenge-text">
                    You also see that I used console.log() to print out the variable. This is a function that
                    allows us to print out the variable to the console. The console is a place where we
                    can see the output of our code and debug our code. We can also use console.log() to print out
                    messages to the console. This is useful for debugging our code and seeing what is happening in our
                    code.
                    Personally I use console.log() to see if certain parts of my code are working or not.
                </p>
                <p class="challenge-text">
                    But Heather! Which ones do I know when to use? Well, let is the most common one used in
                    Javascript. It is used to declare variables that can be changed later on in the code.
                    Const is used to declare variables that cannot be changed later on in the code. It is used to
                    declare constants that will not change throughout the code. Var is used to declare variables
                    that can be changed later on in the code but it is not recommended to use it.
                </p>

                <p class="challenge-text">
                    For your challenge please create and print three variables using let, const and var.
                    Then print them out to the console using console.log(). Once you have done that you will get the
                    crown!
                    ALSO keep in mind that we are using JavaScript so we need to put our code inside the js input box.

                    There are different types of data types in javascript. The most common are Strings, Null, Boolean,
                    and Symbols.
                    There are also non primitive data types such as Objects, Arrays and Functions. Primitive data types
                    are like little blocks
                    or like basic toys.

                <p class="challenge-text">
                    <li>Strings: A word or sequence such as "Hello World"</li>

                    <li>Boolean: ONLY true or false</li>

                <p class="challenge-text">
                    Non primitive data types are like big boxes and a little more complex. These are like boxes that
                    hold a bunch of stuff in them.

                    As we introduced in the last challenge, functions are like little robots that do something when you
                    push a button.
                    Functions in Javascript are used to perform a specific task. They are like little machines that take
                    in input, do something with it, and then give you output.
                    Lets show you a function that adds two numbers together.

                <p class="challenge-text">
                    Control statements in Javascript handle decision making with conditions and repeat taks using loops.
                    They
                    help control the flow of the program based on the logic. They pretty much help us do something but
                    only if a certain case happens.
                    or to keep doing something until we say stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two big kind of control statements are conditional statements and loops. Conditional Statements make
                    decisions and lets our code
                    choose what to do depending if the condition is true or false.
                    For example, if we want to check if a number is greater than 10, we can use an if statement.
                    If statements are used to check if a condition is true or false. If the condition is true, the code
                    inside the if statement will run.
                    If the condition is false, the code inside the if statement will not run.
                    Here is an example of an if statement:
                </p>
                <div class="coding-example">
                    <p class="code-text">

                        <!-- // &lt; is a '<' and &gt; is a '>' -->
                        <!-- TODO: Add an example of an if statement -->
                </div>
                <p>
                    Loops are used to repeat things over and over. We have a for loop which is used to repeat a block of
                    code a certain number of times.
                    We also have a while loop which is used to repeat a block of code while a condition is true.
                    Here is an example of a for loop:
                </p>
                <div class="coding-example">
                    <p class="code-text">

                    Objects in Javascript are like collections of key-value pairs. Lets say we have an object like our
                    backpacks.
                    Inside our backpacks we have an apple, a note book and a pencil.
                    We can represent this in Javascript as an object. The keys are the items in our backpack and the
                    values are the
                    properties of those items.

                    above that lists the home, forts, chat, help and login button. Next we have the side bar that
                    could
                    be used for
                    ads, links or other information. Content is the main part of the webpage where the main
                    information
                    is displayed. The footer is the bottom of the webpage where you can put the copyright
                    information.
                    One other thing
                    we should note are comments when you want to add a comment to your code you can use the
                    <!-- comment here --> tag
                    Behind the scenes of this webpage are many MANY comments that help the developers understand the

                    We can add Hyperlinks to our webpage using the &lt;a&gt; tag. The &lt;a&gt; tag is used to
                    create a

                    Now lets go ahead and create a list in HTML. One good starter after this would be making a to-do
                    list which we can do together. So there
                    are two different types of lists in HTML, there is an unordered and ordered lists. An unordered
                    list
                    is a list with dots and these lists doesnt matter the order. We will open
                    up a list with the &lt;ul&gt; tag and close it with the &lt;/ul&gt; tag. In an ordered lists is
                    things that do go in order like instructions to a receipe so these will
                    be numbered. We will open up a list with the &lt;ol&gt; tag and close it with the &lt;/ol&gt;
                    tag.
                    Here is an example of an unordered list and ordered list. Now go an create an unordered and
                    ordered list to get the crown!

                    Promises in Javascript are used to handle asynchronous operations. They are like a promise that
                    something will happen in the future.
                    Promises can be in three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. When a promise is pending, it
                    means that the operation is still happening. When a promise is fulfilled, it means that the
                    operation has completed successfully. When a promise is rejected, it means that the operation has
                    failed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why do we need promises? Promises are used to handle things suck as API calls, loading images,
                    getting data from a database or even
                    downloading a file. When we use promises are whenever we are doing something that takes time to
                    complete.
                    If we didnt use promises, our code would stop allowing for the browser to possibly freeze or crash.

                    DOM: Document Object Model is a way for saying that we can manipulate the HTML and CSS of a webpage
                    using Javascript.
                    On code.college and most websites there is alot of DOM maniplation going on. For example, when you
                    click a button and something happens, that is DOM manipulation.
                    We can use Javascript to get elements from the HTML and change them or add new elements to the HTML.
                    Here is an example of how to get an element from the HTML and change its text.

                    Error handeling in Javascrript is used to (not to state the obvious) but handle errors that may
                    occur in our code.
                    We can use try and catch statements to handle errors in our code so that when Javascript doesnt
                    understand something or soemthing goes wrong
                    it can prevent our code from crashing.
                    Here is an example of how to use try and catch statements in Javascript.

                <p class="challenge-text">
                    Now before we talked about asynchronous behavior and how it is used to handle things that take time
                    to complete.
                    Synchronous behavior is when our code runs in order and waits for each line to complete before
                    moving on to the next line.
                    This is the default behavior of Javascript. However, we can use asynchronous behavior to handle
                    things that take time to complete such as API calls, loading images, or downloading files.
                    We can use the async and await keywords to handle asynchronous behavior in our code. Dynamic
                    Behavior in Javascript means things are changing and updating while the page is running.
                    For example when you click a button and something happens, that is dynamic behavior.
                    Here is an example of how to use async and await in our code.

                    Defer and Async are two attributes that can be used in the script tag to load JavaScript files.
                    Defer is used to load a JavaScript file after the HTML has been ready. Async is used to load the
                    scripts as soon as its ready Eventsif the page isnt finished loading.

                <p class="challenge-text"> Okay now this stuff that I am going to teach you next is going to be WHY I
                    created this website.
                    YES. all of these websites teach you how to code but they don't teach you how to make a website.
                    I am going to teach you how to make a website. Okay now STAY WITH ME. and please watch my videos if
                    you have any questions hehe.
                    Without furthur ado lets go ahead and download VS code and get started with the basics of making a
                    website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing you need to do is download VS code. VS code is a text editor that you can use to
                    write your code.
                    You can download it from the link below.
                    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Download VS Code</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    then you say OMG which one do I download!?
                    <img src="fire.gif" alt="fire gif" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
                    dont worry we are going to download one for which ever operating system you are using. Now give
                    yourself a round of applause because this is your new best friend.
                    <img src="patrick.jpg" alt="patrick meme" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
                    So why do I need this? Well this is going to be the home for your code and where you will be able to
                    see real life
                    changes to your code. Now we are going to shift over to the basics of VS code. Now lets create your
                    first folder by clicking on Open
                    Most workspaces are created in our Documents folder. So lets go ahead and create a new folder in
                    your Documents folder.
                    Once you create that folder go ahead and open it in VS code. Now you are ready to start coding!
                    Now we are going to create a new file by clicking on the new file button and here use the
                    boilerplate code that we learned in the first challenge.
                </p>
                <p>In order to get the crown for this challenge please upload your index.html file in the space below.
                    If all looks well you will recieve the crown!</p>

                 Add a file reader 
                <button type="button" class="start-button" onclick="startFunction()">Start</button>
                <input type="text" placeholder="Crown"></input>
                <button type="button" class="submit-crown" onclick="submitFunction()">Submit</button>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="collapsible">VS Code Files</button>

                <p class="challenge-text">
                    Okay so you downloaded VS code and you created a index.html file. Lets go ahead and go into the WHY?
                    (my favoirte question about everything).
                    WHY did i create a index.html file? Files are used to store information and need to end with ".html"
                    to let the computer know that it is a webpage.
                    HTML is the language for webpages so the browser knows how to display/read the information.
                    Now the next part ISNT required but its important as developers for us to learn how to publish our
                    websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you have your files but keep in mind that you are the only one that can see them. Other people
                    cant view the website.... YET.
