                    Okay so first thing is first. What is HTML & CSS?HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is
                    used to create and structure the content on webpages. Think of this as the structure of a house. It
                    gives the house its shape and tells you where the rooms/windows/doors go. CSS stands for Cascading
                    Style
                    Sheets. It is used to style the content on webpages. Think of this as the paint and decorations of a
                    house.
                    It givesthe house its color and style.

                    Now what? The hell am I supposed to do with this? Well, dont panic just yet! Now we are going to go
                    into the basics of HTML.
                    <!-- Talk about headers paragraphs-->
                </p>
                <p class="challenge-text">
                    lets talk about the structure of code.college. Everything here on the website is inside of our HTML
                    boilerplate. The first thing you see is the header. The header is where you put the title of your
                    webpage. The title is what shows up on the tab of your browser. The next thing
                    you see is the body. The body is where you put all the content of your webpage. This is where you
                    put all the text, images, and videos that you want to show up on your webpage. The body is like the
                    main part of your webpage. It is where all the action happens.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Headers are represented by the &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; tags. The
                    &lt;h1&gt; tag is the largest header and the&lt;/h6&gt; tag
                    is the smallest header. Paragraphs are represented by the &lt;p&gt; tag and is used to create a
                    new paragraph. You may also notice that there are opening and closing tags. The opening tag just
                    shows where to start and end an element. The closing tag is the same as the opening tag but with a /
                    before the element name.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now that you know a little bit about headers and paragraphs lets try to make some headers and
                    paragraphs to get the crown!
                </p>

                <input type="text" placeholder="Crown"></input>
                <button type="button" class="submit-button" onclick="submitFunction()">Submit</button>

            <div class="bar-content">
                <p class="challenge-text"> Okay yay! We see what headers are now and we can go ahead and learn about my
                    next favorite HTML concepts. Divs and Spans!
                    <img src="keepGoing.jpg" alt="keep going meme" style="width:48px;height:48px;">
                    Divs and Spans are used to group elements together. Think of them as containers. Divs are block
                    containers like a big box that you can use to put stuff inside it. Spans is like a small sticker
                    that you can put on something. Its not a big box like a div its just for something you want to
                    highlight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    here is an example and output of what we should expect for our divs and spans
                </p>
                <p>
                    now that you know a little bit about divs and spans lets try to make some divs and spans to get the

                    lets go ahead and go over the HTML layout. The layout of a webpage is how the elements are arranged
                    on the page.
                    The layout is what makes the webpage look good. The layout is what makes the webpage easy to read.
                    The layout is what makes the webpage easy to use. This is used by elements like header, nav, main,
                    article, section, aside and footer
                </p>
                <p>
                    The header is the top used for the website logo like code.college! the navigation bar is the menu
                    above that lists the home, forts, chat, help and login button. Next we have the side bar that could
                    be used for
                    ads, links or other information. Content is the main part of the webpage where the main information
                    is displayed. The footer is the bottom of the webpage where you can put the copyright information.
                    One other thing
                    we should note are comments when you want to add a comment to your code you can use the
                    <!-- comment here --> tag
                    Behind the scenes of this webpage are many MANY comments that help the developers understand the
                    code and what it does.

                <p class="challenge-text"> Okay now this stuff that I am going to teach you next is going to be WHY I
                    created this website.
                    YES. all of these websites teach you how to code but they don't teach you how to make a website.
                    I am going to teach you how to make a website. Okay now STAY WITH ME. and please watch my videos if
                    you have any questions hehe.
                    Without furthur ado lets go ahead and download VS code and get started with the basics of making a
                    website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing you need to do is download VS code. VS code is a text editor that you can use to
                    write your code.
                    You can download it from the link below.
                    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Download VS Code</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    then you say OMG which one do I download!?
                    <img src="fire.gif" alt="fire gif" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
                    dont worry we are going to download one for which ever operating system you are using. Now give
                    yourself a round of applause because this is your new best friend.
                    <img src="patrick.jpg" alt="patrick meme" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
                    So why do I need this? Well this is going to be the home for your code and where you will be able to
                    see real life
                    changes to your code. Now we are going to shift over to the basics of VS code. Now lets create your
                    first folder by clicking on Open
                    Most workspaces are created in our Documents folder. So lets go ahead and create a new folder in
                    your Documents folder.
                    Once you create that folder go ahead and open it in VS code. Now you are ready to start coding!
                    Now we are going to create a new file by clicking on the new file button and here use the
                    boilerplate code that we learned in the first challenge.
                </p>
                <p>In order to get the crown for this challenge please upload your index.html file in the space below.
                    If all looks well you will recieve the crown!</p>

                <button type="button" class="start-button" onclick="startFunction()">Start</button>
                <input type="text" placeholder="Crown"></input>
                <button type="button" class="submit-crown" onclick="submitFunction()">Submit</button>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible" id="collapsible">VS Code Files</button>
            <div class="bar-content">
                <p class="challenge-text">
                    Okay so you downloaded VS code and you created a index.html file. Lets go ahead and go into the WHY?
                    (my favoirte question about everything).
                    WHY did i create a index.html file? Files are used to store information and need to end with ".html"
                    to let the computer know that it is a webpage.
                    HTML is the language for webpages so the browser knows how to display/read the information.
                    Now the next part ISNT required but its important as developers for us to learn how to publish our
                    websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you have your files but keep in mind that you are the only one that can see them. Other people
                    cant view the website.... YET.
